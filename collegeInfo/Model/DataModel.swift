You attended elementary school, junior high, and high school based upon where you lived and the boundaries for those districts.  Now, you can choose among some 3600 colleges and universities, just within the United States alone.  You can decide to go to the East Coast or the West Coast, to a large public institution of over 35,000 students or a small private liberal arts institution of under 2000 students, to a school located in an urban setting or a rural or suburban environment."]),

This process is personal and must begin with self-reflection.  You must consider many things about yourself: what type of person you are, your values and morals, what type of learner you are, your goals, strengths, weaknesses, and your reasons for going to college.  Selecting a college is about matching the answers to these questions to a college that will provide an environment that will promote and encourage you to continue your self-development."]),

Now think of where you are now.  You probably have undergone many changes personally, socially, and academically.  You have learned more about yourself, what interests you, what bores you, what motivates you, etc.  Your values and morals have changed.  Your attitudes towards school, homework and/or friends may have changed, as well as your political, social, and economic positions or interests.  All of this in less than 2.5 years!  Well, this growth pattern will continue as you look to go to college (and beyond).  Therefore, the decision-making process that you, the student, and your parents will undergo throughout the next eighteen months is developmental; as you change during the next several months through your experiences both in and out of Glenbrook North High School, so too will your interests and desired characteristics for a college."]),

The fit of the college is determined through matching the student’s desired characteristics with a college that contains those characteristics.  These characteristics can include a number of interests such as distance, size, character of the student body, location, academic offerings, religious presence, etc.  Make a shopping list of the characteristics that you are interested in finding on a college campus.  With the shopping list you then will have the tools to go out and find a college that will be the best fit for you! Remember, the best college is determined by you, not by a ranking, the media, or anybody else.  The best college is the college which fits your shopping list."]),

Another way to look at it is, do I want to be on that college campus for four years? Will I feel comfortable there? Will I fit in? Will it feel like my home away from home?  During that cold early November weekday as you are finishing a term paper at 1:30 a.m., you will be more interested in knowing that you like the campus because you are comfortable and it is a good fit for you, rather than the question of could I get admitted to the college.  In addition, many will ask you the question, “Do you want to be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond?” You are encouraged to take a different direction with the question.  Ask yourself, will I be comfortable in the pond?  If a student is comfortable in the pond, then the idea of being the big fish or the small fish will come easily to the student."]),

It is important for you to remember that, as all members of the team provide advice and information to you, and as you talk with friends and family members, you must determine whether what you hear about various institutions are facts or rumors.  Information you gather and experiences you hear about can be wonderful information for you to formulate perceptions regarding college campuses.  Please be careful not to make a rash decision based upon one individual’s experience that might have only been a result of a 15- or 20-minute extraordinary circumstance that happened to that student while on campus."]),

                ContentItem(contentType: .paragraph, content: ["As mentioned in section I, one of the main responsibilities of an admission representative is to determine whether or not his/her college is a good fit for you.  With this determination comes the issue of admissibility, the act of deciding if a student should be admitted or denied to the institution.  The philosophy of college admission can be seen in two different ways.  First, the college admission rep wants to determine whether or not a student has the ability and potential to succeed at the institution.  It serves no purpose for a college to admit a student who would not be able to meet the academic challenges of the curriculum.  Unfortunately, a college may choose to deny a student not because they find the student could not handle the rigors of the curriculum, but simply because they have too many qualified candidates for admission.  The second question the admission representative seeks to answer is, has the student used his or her ability and potential while in high school."]),
                
                ContentItem(contentType: .paragraph, content: ["Many students and parents view the college admission process as a “rewarding” system, the payoff for all the hard work while at GBN.  You, as a student at Glenbrook North, are encouraged not to see the admission process as a reward for your high school work and dedication, but as an opportunity for you to continue your education at a post-secondary institution.  The reward for your hard work and dedication will come with your success in academics while at college as you find courses challenging yet manageable."]),

                ContentItem(contentType: .paragraph, content: ["There are two types of methods that an institution can use while trying to answer the above questions.  The first method, the objective admission decision, is an index-based admission decision or criteria-based admission.  With objective admission a set ACT/SAT score and/or a grade point average (GPA) score typically determines the admission decision.  With this type of decision, the GPA and/or class rank (if calculated by the high school) is compared to the ACT/SAT score of the student on a sliding scale.  As the grade point average goes up, then the expected (required) ACT/SAT score is lowered, and vice versa.  Sometimes a college will have a minimum GPA score and when that is met, the ACT score is irrelevant.  If the minimum GPA is not met, more weight will be placed upon the ACT.  For instance, the University of Kansas requires a 2.5 or above for automatic offer of admission.  However, if a student’s grade point average falls below a 2.5, then the student’s ACT score must meet a certain index requirement."]),

                ContentItem(contentType: .paragraph, content: ["The second method of admission is the subjective admission decision.  The subjective admission decision looks at the student’s entire application, including but not limited to the student’s GPA, rank (if calculated by the high school), course selection (by academic year and overall), teacher and counselor recommendations, ACT/SAT scores, extracurricular activities, essays, etc.  In this type of admission decision, the college admission representative seeks to establish a correlation between the grade point average and the ACT/SAT score.  For example, if a student has a strong GPA yet the ACT/SAT score falls below the national norm, the college admission representative will conclude that the student’s strengths and academic accomplishments are earned through day to day hard work and motivation that was put into homework, quizzes, course participation, essays, small group projects, etc.  If a student has a strong ACT/SAT score but the grade point average is not indicative of that ACT/SAT score, then the college admission representative can fairly conclude that the student has not achieved to his or her potential, which once again is one of the questions that needs to be answered during the admission process.  Therefore, during the subjective admission decision, the grade point average and the ACT score are closely examined to determine a relationship between the two."]),

                ContentItem(contentType: .paragraph, content: ["Regardless of the college admission policy, the most important aspect of your folder is the academic record.  While viewing your transcript, college admission representatives look for two things.  First, they look to see what you have taken each year during high school.  They want to see how many academic solids (English, math, science, social science, and world language) you have taken your freshman, sophomore, and junior years, and, yes, even your senior year.  In addition, they want to see what type of elective courses you have taken to round out the transcript.  It is a general expectation that you have five academic courses freshman, sophomore, and junior year and a minimum of four academic courses during your senior year.  Colleges look to see what you have taken overall during the four years of high school.  Some colleges will require a certain number of years in English (typically four), a minimum number of mathematics courses (typically four), a minimum number of two to three years of social studies, a minimum of two to three years of natural or physical science, and a minimum of two years of the same foreign language (at some institutions, fine arts courses can be submitted for foreign language courses). While college admission representatives read through your transcript, they're evaluating: 1) courses selected by year, and 2) courses taken over the four years of high school.  This is why you cannot have an “easy” senior year."]),

                ContentItem(contentType: .paragraph, content: ["Also, while examining your academic record, college representatives are interested in your grade point average.  They’re interested in determining the trend of your grade point average, whether it has gone up, dropped over time, or remained consistent across the years.  Some colleges will only look at the academic grade point average; others will look at the all-subject grade point average, while others will take into consideration whichever is higher.  The academic grade point average is determined by the consideration of weighted grades in the academic studies (English, mathematics, social studies, science, foreign language, or other elective courses at the Advanced Placement or honors level).  The all-subject grade point average takes into account all courses taken and equalizes the point values, regardless of whether a course is honors or advanced placement.  Both the academic and all-subject grade point averages are based on a 4.00 scale. The following grade point system is used in determining grade point averages:"]),

                ContentItem(contentType: .paragraph, content: ["It is first important to note that standardized testing is only a part of the admission decision.  Far too often, time, attention and stress is directed towards the ACT/SAT when it should have been directed towards other aspects of the college admission application process.  One main issue that needs to be addressed is that of holding scores. Colleges will not penalize a student based upon submission of two ACT/SAT scores in which one might be higher.  You are encouraged to have your ACT/SAT scores mailed during registration for these tests. (As students register for these examinations, the respective testing agencies provide up to four free test score releases in which they will send the student’s score to the college of the student’s choice.)  When colleges receive two different ACT scores for one student, they will indeed take the higher score for the admission decision.  For example, if a student earned a 24 on the ACT during the June administration date and had those scores mailed directly to the colleges, but then received a 26 during the September administration, the college will evaluate and utilize the 26 ACT score while making a decision on the student.  In fact, some colleges might take the sub-score of each ACT test administration to re-compute a higher composite score for the student (superscore).  You are strongly encouraged not to hold back your ACT/SAT scores.  Far too often a student’s admission decision is delayed due to a student not releasing ACT/SAT scores until well after the administration dates.  Once again, colleges are looking for the student’s highest score.  Look at it this way.  It is self-serving for a college to include the highest status score during the evaluation as that will increase the college’s statistical profile in the long run (which is a major aspect of the ranking system we see in today’s media)."]),

There are three types of essays.  The first is where you will answer a question asked by the college.  The second type of essay is the open-ended essay in which a college allows and provides you with the opportunity to write about anything of interest to you.  The third essay is initiated by you.  You will use this opportunity to directly address an issue or concern with the college about yourself as a student.  Typically, this essay is most appropriate when you do not meet the admission requirements of the college, and thus would like to explain special circumstances and reasons for the grade on the transcript.  It is not the time to give excuses, but reasons."]),

Many times students will be requested by colleges to submit teacher recommendations as well as a counselor recommendation.  It is suggested that you use the premise of two teacher recommendations and one counselor recommendation.  The idea of the teacher recommendation is to give a general feel for what type of student you are on a day-to-day basis, what type of student you are in class, the type of learner you are, your contributions to class, your willingness to accept criticism on homework, etc.  Your teacher is your advocate while illustrating to the college admission representative the type of student you are in class.  They can write about how you have developed over the years at GBN, relating to other students and contributing to the GBN community. Your counselor recommendation will share with them who you are as a student overall.  It is highly recommended that you choose teachers from your junior or senior year.  You should refrain from going to sophomore year teachers and definitely not freshman year teachers.  The idea of the teacher recommendation is to get a sense of what type of student you are currently.  In addition, many students feel that it is necessary to ask a teacher in whose class the student earned a high grade (A or B) to write recommendations for him or her.  This may not be the best teacher to ask.  If you worked hard and took class seriously, sought out extra help from the teacher, and earned a grade of B or C in that class, that teacher might be able to provide more insight into your hard work, perseverance and dedication, even though you earned a grade lower than an A."]),

Activities are an important part of the application folder, as the college admission representatives will look at them to answer this question.  Remember, that it is not a laundry list of activities that the admission representatives are looking for, but the commitment and passion that you have invested in an activity.  They are looking to see how you were affected by the activity and how the activity has benefited from your participation.  Please keep in mind that activities are looked at to see what you have done outside the classroom.  For some students it is necessary for them to work a part-time job, thus preventing participation in school activities.  This is fine and acceptable to the colleges.  If a student works either for financial necessity or simply for interest reasons, the admission representatives will evaluate his/her work for similar characteristics regarding commitment and passion to one's work.

At more competitive, selective institutions, the interview can become more question- and answer-based.  The key to keep in mind while interviewing is to be yourself! While answering questions, do not answer them the way you believe the interviewer wants them answered.  They are not looking for a correct answer, but for your ability to represent and articulate your position.  Whether it is a political, economic, religious or philosophical position, the interviewer is not seeking out your beliefs to form a stereotype and/or opinion, but to seek out your ability to represent and support your position.
